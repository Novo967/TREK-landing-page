    <h1>Child Safety Standards & Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 14, 2026</p>
    
    <p>TREK is committed to maintaining a safe environment for all users. We have a zero-tolerance policy regarding Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE).</p>

    <h2>1. Prohibited Content</h2>
    <p>Users are strictly prohibited from uploading, sharing, or promoting any content that depicts, encourages, or normalizes the sexual abuse or exploitation of children.</p>

    <h2>2. Reporting Mechanism</h2>
    <p>We provide in-app reporting tools for users to flag inappropriate content. All reports related to child safety are prioritized and reviewed immediately.</p>

    <h2>3. Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
    <p>If we detect or receive reports of CSAE content, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the content immediately.</li>
        <li>Terminate the user's account permanently.</li>
        <li>Report the incident to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and relevant law enforcement agencies as required by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Contact Us</h2>
